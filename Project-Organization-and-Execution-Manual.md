**Project Organization and Execution Manual**

This document provides a structured approach to managing and prioritizing tasks for your GitHub project board.

## **Defining Bug Severity Levels**

Use these severity levels to categorize and prioritize bugs:

* **Critical (Red):** Fix immediately.  
   **Definition:** Blocking core functionality.  
   **Examples:** Login failure, payment issues, app crashes.

* **High (Orange):** Fix as soon as possible.  
   **Definition:** Disrupts major features but has a workaround.  
   **Examples:** Broken navigation, major UI misalignment.

* **Medium (Yellow):** Fix after higher-priority tasks.  
   **Definition:** Minor disruptions to user experience.  
   **Examples:** Slow-loading pages, dropdown issues.

* **Low (Green):** Fix when time permits.  
   **Definition:** Cosmetic or low-impact issues.  
   **Examples:** Typos, minor alignment problems.

## **Labels for Task Management**

Organize your tasks with these labels:

### **Bug Severity Labels**

* `critical` (red): Fix immediately, blocks core functionality.  
* `high` (orange): Fix soon, major feature disruption.  
* `medium` (yellow): Fix later, minor disruptions.  
* `low` (green): Fix when time permits, cosmetic issues.

### **Enhancement Priority Labels**

* `must-have`: Essential features or improvements.  
* `nice-to-have`: Non-essential but improves experience.  
* `future-feature`: Planned for later phases.

### **Urgency Labels**

* `urgent`: Needs immediate attention.  
* `low-priority`: Can wait until higher-priority tasks are complete.

### **Project-Specific Labels**

* Use custom labels like `portfolio`, `e-commerce`, etc.

### **Applying Labels**

1. Assign severity labels to bugs based on their impact.  
2. Use enhancement labels for feature requests.  
3. Mark time-sensitive tasks with urgency labels.  
4. Group tasks by project using custom project labels.

## **Solo Developer Organization Tips**

* **Daily Updates:** Update your board at the end of each session. Move tasks between columns like `To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done`.  
* **Weekly Planning:** Choose 2–3 tasks to focus on each week.  
* **Avoid Overcommitting:** Stick to 1 bug \+ 1 enhancement per day.

---

## **Preventing Momentum Loss**

* **Leave Notes:** Add reminders when pausing tasks.  
   *Example:* “Started fixing navbar but need to test on mobile.”  
* **Set Milestones:** Group related tasks under phases like `v1.0.0` or `v1.1.0`.  
* **Momentum Tasks:** Use smaller tasks (e.g., updating documentation) to regain focus.

---

## **Prioritizing Tasks**

Use the **Impact vs. Effort Matrix** to prioritize:

* **High Impact, Low Effort:** Do first.  
* **High Impact, High Effort:** Plan carefully.  
* **Low Impact, Low Effort:** Do if time permits.  
* **Low Impact, High Effort:** Postpone or drop.

---

## **Setting Up Milestones**

Organize tasks into milestones with a clear versioning system:

### **Versioning Example**

* **v1.0.0:** Initial release with basic features.  
* **v1.1.0:** New features or enhancements.  
* **v1.1.1:** Bug fixes.  
* **v1.2.0:** Major improvements.

### **Milestone Example for E-commerce Platform**

* **v1.0.0:** Login, product listing, cart functionality.  
* **v1.1.0:** Payment gateway integration.  
* **v1.1.1:** Fix checkout bugs.  
* **v1.2.0:** Add reviews and ratings.

## **Solo Meetings**

Schedule regular check-ins with yourself:

* **Weekly Review Meeting:**

  * Plan your week.  
  * Reflect on:  
    * What did I complete?  
    * What’s blocking me?  
    * What are my top priorities?  
* **Daily Check-Ins:**

  * Start your day by selecting 1–3 tasks.  
  * End the day by updating task statuses and adding notes.  
* **Retro Meeting (End of Milestone):**

  * Reflect on progress:  
    * What went well?  
    * What challenges did I face?  
    * How can I improve?

## **Focus Sprints**

A focus sprint is a short, dedicated effort on key tasks.

### **How to Set Up a Focus Sprint**

1. **Duration:** 1–2 weeks.  
2. **Select Tasks:** Choose 3–5 high-priority tasks.  
3. **Commit:** Focus exclusively on these tasks.  
4. **Review Progress:** Adjust tasks for the next sprint.

### **Benefits**

* Prevents multitasking.  
* Keeps you goal-oriented.  
* Helps measure progress in smaller increments.
